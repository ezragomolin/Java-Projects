FinalBouncingBalls - This program is the final continuation of BouncingBall, BallsScattering and SortingAndStackingBalls. This program brings all of these programs togeather by allowing users to choose the parameters such as (number of balls being scatted, minimum radius, minimum launch angle etc...) Finally you have the option to run the simulation, clear the samulation, stop the simulation and sort it. This program focuses on developing a user friendly interface with sliders and buttons. Note: This program uses and external Jar acm.jar.

SortingAndStackingBalls - This program is a continuation of BallsScattering. This program sorts all the balls in increasing radius, if some of the balls have the same radius than they are stacked on top of one another. This program implements a binary tree. Note: This program uses and external Jar acm.jar.

BallsScattering - This program is a continuation of BouncingBall except this program simulates 100 balls all with randomly chosen parameters bouncing untill at rest. Note: This program uses and external Jar acm.jar.

BouncingBall - This program simulates a real life kinematics trajectory of a ball bouncing. The program takes user's input (initial velocity, energy loss paramter, launch angle and the balls radius) and performs the simulation. Note: This program uses and external Jar acm.jar.

CatTree - This program implements a binary tree using cats as nodes. These cats have the following attributes: age, fur thickness and a name. This program implements adding or removing the cat (node) to their corresponding position on their tree which depend on their corresponding attributes relative to the nodes already in the tree.

SearchingThroughADataBase- This program is designed to simulate searching through a twitter database, this program focuses on time efficiency and creates a hashTabel from scratch. 

TravelAgency - This program simulates an online travel agency using 8 classes. This program can deal with airport and hotel reservatios. As well as room types and additional travel services. This program is fairly simple and is designed for understanding basic java arithmetic/code as well as developing a linked list from scratch.

ConfusingTrainRide - This program implements a shuffling network of train stations with different train lines and simulates a trip for a rider with many restrictions. This program outlines sevral important programming skills such as sorting methods etc.
